# diffusion-llms
Making LLMs inference faster with diffusion.

## Rules
Everybody **must** use its own branch during development, together we handle merges.

Create a branch locally:
```
git branch <branch_name>
```
Move to that branch and work on it
```
git checkout <branch_name>
```
Push local branch to remote branch (create remote branch if not existing)
```
git push -u origin <branch-name> 
```
Check what remote branch your current branch is tracking
```
git branch -vv
```
Check list of available branches
```
git branch -a
```
